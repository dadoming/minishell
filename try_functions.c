/**
 *  readline(char* prompt)      ->  will read from the terminal and return it. Keybindings work like emacs.
 *                                  It will cause bytes to be allocated and when using Valgrind it will appear
 *                                  as "Still reachable", that is not a memory leak! A memory leak is bytes lost 
 *                                  that are not reachable. - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55196451/gnu-readline-enormous-memory-leak
 * 
 *  add_history(char *buffer)   ->  adds buffer to history 
 *  
 *  rl_clear_history(void)      ->  clears history.
 * 
 *  rl_on_new_line(void)        ->  "Tell the update routines that we have moved onto a new (empty) line, usually after ouputting a newline."
 *                                  Maybe to use when terminal executes some command?
 *  
 *  rl_redisplay(void)          ->  "Change what's displayed on the screen to reflect the current contents of rl_line_buffer."
 *  
 *  rl_replace_line() -> NÃ£o encontrei nada na net.
